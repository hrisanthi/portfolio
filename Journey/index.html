		<h2>Kinethics is an immersive, culturally specific compliance training
			platform that uses real-life cases of corruption to empower and train employees
			of multinational corporations. Our service encourages honest business practices
			by sending users through a “choose your own adventure” game where employees face
			competing incentives and realistic challenges. The training also provides
			aggregated statistics of employee results so that compliance officers can spot
			red flags before they face costly consequences.</h2>

				<p>We all met at Reese News Lab in the basement of Carroll Hall at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, an incubator that creates and tests new ideas for the media industry. A university donor working in the oil and gas industry had approached the university asking that UNC find a way to “combat global corruption.” UNC’s vice chancellor came to Reese News Lab asking for help.

				<p>We took on the challenge like journalists. We researched, we asked questions, we talked to people. We changed our minds again and again. And then we found the story. Corruption — in government, in business and in everyday life — hurts vulnerable populations and stifles economic welfare. Corporate corruption is often called simply “the cost of doing business” abroad. But that doesn’t have to be the case. Companies aren’t just following the social norms of the land. They’re helping shape those norms.

				<p>After talking to compliance officers and training users, we found that compliance training often focuses on black and white legal issues that don’t reflect the true reality on the ground. One user told us that most courses consist of “check the box activities without any consequences.” They’re also boring, using dry videos or text and quizzes.
